            <p>
                I'm the creator of Pink Recipe Hub — a passion project born from my love for delicious food,
                creativity, and a touch of elegance. I believe cooking should be fun, expressive, and beautiful.

            <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
            <p>
                This website is more than just a collection of recipes — it's a reflection of my journey in
                learning web development and combining it with something I truly enjoy: food. I hope it inspires
                you to explore new dishes and enjoy the process of cooking.
